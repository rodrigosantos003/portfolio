                    As a software developer with 5 years&apos; experience, I like to turn innovative ideas into practical solutions.
                    My journey into the world of technology has been marked by a curiosity and passion for programming.
                    My knowledge spans several programming languages, including JavaScript, C#, C and Java.
                    These languages are not just tools in my hands, they are the means by which I bring ideas to life and solve complex problems.
                    I enjoy the challenge of creating efficient code needed for real-world applications. Being a tech enthusiast, I&apos;m always on the lookout for the latest trends and advances in the industry.
                    I&apos;m currently studying Software Engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of Set√∫bal.
